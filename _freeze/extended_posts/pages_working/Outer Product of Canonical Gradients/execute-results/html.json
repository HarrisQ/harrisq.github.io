Then any subsequent model built upon the supervised features should be more interpretable as well. In terms of interpretability, the supervised features are easier to visualize, since they are lower dimensional summaries and we only have a few to consider. We can plot the supervised features against the outcome in 1d, 2d, and 3d graphics, which can help build a better understanding of the relationship between the outcome and predictors. \n\n\n# An Illustration\n\nTo illustrate the objective of SDR methods, we can look at a simple example. \nLet $X = (X_1, X_2) \\in [0,1]^2$ be a bivariate predictor in the unit square and let $Y \\in \\R$ be a quadratic function of $X_1$ only. \nThen, if $\\beta = (1,0) \\in \\R^2$, the outcome $Y$ can be expressed as $Y = \\beta^\\top X$.\n\n![sdr plot](../images/sdr/sdr_plot.png){width=40% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\nFor $$\n\\begin{split}\nY \\indep X \\mid \\beta^\\top X   \n\\end{split}\n$$\n",
