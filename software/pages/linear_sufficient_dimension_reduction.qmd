The package *linearsdr* contains some implementations for simple sufficient dimension reduction methods, including **Sliced Inverse Regression (SIR)**, **Sliced Average Variance Estimator (SAVE)**, **Directional Regression (DR)** and **Outer Product of Gradients (OPG)**.
The package also contains implementation of the **Outer Product of Canonical Gradients (OPCG)** and **Minimum Average Deviance Estimation (MADE)** from the paper

The package, along with some examples, can be found [here](https://harrisq.github.io/linearsdr/)

  * Contains R Code for the Outer Prodcut of Canonical Gradients (OPCG) and Minimum Average Deviance Estimation (MADE) methods developed in 

  * Contains R Code for other linear SDR methods: OPG, MAVE, SIR, SAVE, and DR

  * Provides a Tikhonov regularization option for SIR, SAVE and DR to naively handle rank-deficient covariance matrices.
