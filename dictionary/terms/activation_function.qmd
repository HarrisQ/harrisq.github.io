description: A function that follows the [linear function](linear_combination.qmd) in a [neuron](neuron.qmd), to introduce nonlinearity.

If there existed no activation function, there would be no point in having individual neurons, as the entire network would become a single, big linear equation.

# With Activation Function
$w_2 \cdot \text{activation}(w_1 x + b_1) + b_2$

# Without Activation Function
$w_2 \cdot (w_1 x + b_1) + b_2 = w_2 w_1 x + w_2 b_1 + b_2$
