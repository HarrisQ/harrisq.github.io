The learning rate controls how much the [gradients](gradients.qmd) adjust the parameters by multiplying the learning rate and [gradients](gradients.qmd) together.

# Note

A learning rate that is too high can cause the training system to either get stuck in a loop or diverge from the optimal weights.

A learning rate that is too low can cause the training system to take a very long time to reach the optimal weights.
