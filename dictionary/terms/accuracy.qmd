title: Accuracy
description: "A type of [metric](metric.qmd). It is a value that tells us how often a model produces correct predictions. The higher the accuracy, the better."
---

---

It can be calculated by dividing the number of correct predictions by the number of total predictions. Optionally multiply the result by 100 to obtain a percentage.

$$
\frac{\text{number of correct predictions}}{\text{number of total predictions}}
$$

Accuracy is also 1 - [error rate](error_rate.qmd).
