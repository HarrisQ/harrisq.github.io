title: "Error Rate"
description: "A type of [metric](metric.qmd). It is a value that tells us how often a model produces incorrect predictions. The lower the error rate, the better."
---

---

It can be calculated by dividing the number of incorrect predictions by the number of total predictions. Optionally multiply the result by 100 to obtain a percentage.

$$
\frac{\text{number of incorrect predictions}}{\text{number of total predictions}}
$$

Error rate is also 1 - [accuracy](accuracy.qmd).
