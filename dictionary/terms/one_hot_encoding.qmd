Let's say we have a categorical feature, speed, that can be either slow or fast. Instead of assigning a value of 0 to slow and a value of 1 to fast, a slow column can be created and a fast column can be created. If the speed is slow, slow is true and fast is false. If the speed is fast, slow is false and fast is true.
