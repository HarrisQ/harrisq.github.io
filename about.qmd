I am a Postdoctoral Researcher supervised by [Dr. Wensheng Guo](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/wensheng-guo-phd) and [Dr. Wei Yang](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p5888381) in the Department of Biostatistcs, Epidemiology and Informations (DBEI) at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania.
My research focuses on developing methods to construct summary statistics that describe features in the data that are most relevant to some outcome of interest. 

Currently, my methods development are motivated by electrocardiogram data and cardiovascular endpoints in renal disease patients participating in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study. 

Part of my duties as a postdoctoral researcher includes providing biostatistical support for clinical trials and cohort studies. 

I obtained my PhD in Statistics at [Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/), under the supervision of [Dr. Bing Li](https://science.psu.edu/stat/people/bxl9), where I researched and developed sufficient dimension reduction methods for classification and functional data.
