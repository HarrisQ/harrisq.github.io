Research Interests

My current research focus is on the theoretical and applied aspects of linear and nonlinear forward Sufficient Dimension Reduction (SDR) in the context of functional and high dimensional data.
<!-- I develop supervised dimension reduction methods that extract the most informative and relevant features from functional and high dimensional data for downstream statistical applications, such as regression, classification, prediction, and data visualization. -->

Prior to my doctoral studies at Penn State, I worked on likelihood theory and applications at Toronto.

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)

Learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/poole).

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com), an amazing code editor
* Designed and developed while listening to music like [Blood Bros Trilogy](https://soundcloud.com/maddecent/sets/blood-bros-series)
