Research Interests
---

My research interest is in dimension reduction and information extraction. My current focus is on theoretical and applied aspects of forward Sufficient Dimension Reduction (SDR). 
<!-- I have dabbled in applications of SDR for generating summary statistics in Approximate Bayesian Computations and Indirect Inference, and have explored how Optimal Transport may remedy violations of distributional assumptions for inverse SDR methods.      
 -->

Prior to my doctoral studies at Penn State, I experimented with applications of higher-order likelihood approximations (which is another perspective of dimension reduction) at Toronto.

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com), an amazing code editor
* Designed and developed while listening to music like [Blood Bros Trilogy](https://soundcloud.com/maddecent/sets/blood-bros-series)
