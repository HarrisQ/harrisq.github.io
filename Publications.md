Research Interests
---

Broadly, my research interest is in dimension reduction and information extraction. My current focus is on theoretical and applied aspects of forward Sufficient Dimension Reduction (SDR). I have dabbled in applications of SDR with Approximate Bayesian Computations, Indirect Inference and Optimal Transport.      

Prior to my doctoral studies at Penn State, I experimented with applications of higher-order likelihood methods (which are another form of dimension reduction) at Toronto.

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com), an amazing code editor
* Designed and developed while listening to music like [Blood Bros Trilogy](https://soundcloud.com/maddecent/sets/blood-bros-series)
